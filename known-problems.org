#+TITLE: Known Problems

* GPUs not listed
  When this happens nvidia-smi shows no listed GPUs.
  There is supposed to be a daemon running that keeps the drivers online.
  Sometimes this process fails or does not work properly. In that case we need to restart the daemon.

** How to Fix
  The daemon can be started by running: 

  #+begin_src
  nvidia-persistenced
  #+end_src
  
  If the dawmon was never running in the first place this will succeed.
  If the daemon was previously running and has stopped working this fails with:

  #+begin_src
  nvidia-persistenced failed to initialize. Check syslog for more details.
  #+begin_src
  
  In that case syslog will most likely say:
  #+begin_src
  ... nvidia-persistenced: Failed to open PID file: File exists
  ... nvidia-persistenced: Shutdown (5232)
  #+begin_src
  
  Then we need to find the old process:
  #+begin_src
  ps aux | grep persistenced
  #+begin_src
  
  and kill it:
  
  #+begin_src
  kill <pid>
  #+begin_src
